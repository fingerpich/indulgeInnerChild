## Installation

**1. Clone this repo:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fingerpich/indugeInnerChild.git
cd indugeInnerChild
```

**2. Install the dependencies:**

```sh
npm install
```

> You're done installing! Now let's get started developing.



## Development Workflow


**3. Start a live-reload development server:**

```sh
PORT=8080 npm run dev
```

> This is a full web server nicely suited to your project. Any time you make changes within the `src` directory, it will rebuild and even refresh your browser.


**4. Generate a production build in `./build`:**

```sh
npm run build
```

You can now deploy the contents of the `build` directory to production!

> **Example:** deploy to [surge.sh](https://surge.sh):
>
> `npm i surge && surge build -d my-app.surge.sh`
